## Material list
In order to have a standard reference to get the data, the whole network of IoB should be based on the same devices. We opted for accessible components which require no soldering and are easy to assemble. 

The components are:
- Microprocessor NodeMCU Esp8266 
- Color sensor TCS3200 
- Temperature and humidity sensor DHT11
- 10x jumper cables, 20cm length, female to female.
- USB wall charger
- USB cable Micro-B
- Electrical tape
- Rubber band
- and, of course, a banana*.

The total cost of the components amount to circa 35â‚¬.

Depending of the vendor, the NodeMCU or the sensors may be sold with unsoldered pins, therefore when you are buying them please be sure to choose the already soldered ones! 

Usually the jumper cables are sold in pack of 40 or 20 cables. For the project it will be necessary 10 of them, with female connectors in both ending of the cable. 

The USB charger is the power supply of your IoB. Since it will be powering the IoB on for a whole week long, consider to buy one of reasonable quality. Fast chargers are not necessary, it will make no additional bennefit (nor cause any problem) for the NodeMCU. 

The USB cable Micro-B should be apart from the USB charger (that is, you should be able to disconnect them), so you can use it to upload the code from the computer to the NodeMCU, and after that you can use it in the charger as power supply.

* Please consider buying a fairtrade, organic banana! It won't save the planet, but every little bit helps =)
