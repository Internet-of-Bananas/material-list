# Internet of Bananas
## Material list
In order to have a standard reference to get the data, the whole network of IoB should be based on the same devices. We opted for accessible components which require no soldering. The components are:
- Microprocessor NodeMCU Esp8266 
- Color sensor TCS3200 
- Temperature and humidity sensor DHT11
- Jumper cable female to female
- USB wall charger
- USB cable micro-B
- Electrical tape
- Rubber band
- and, of course, a banana.

The cost of the combined components for augmenting the banana amount to circa 35€.
